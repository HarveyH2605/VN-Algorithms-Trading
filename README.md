# VN-Algorithms-Trading

I am Harvey, a college student majoring in Financial Mathematics with a strong ambition to enter the field of quantitative trading. In Vietnam, the majority of trading systems and strategies rely heavily on technical indicators. However, I believe that this approach falls short in addressing the inherent randomness and dynamic nature of a frontier market like Vietnam.

Driven by a passion for applying pure mathematical and probabilistic models to the Vietnamese stock market, I aim to develop a more sophisticated trading system. Models such as ARIMA, MCMC, and TGARCH will be employed  in this project to explore their potential fit in the Vietnamese context.

The objective of this project is to utilize my mathematical knowledge and theoretical insights to create and validate a robust trading system. By doing so, I hope to contribute to a more advanced and effective trading strategy within the Vietnamese market.
